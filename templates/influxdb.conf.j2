### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = {{ disable_reporting }}

### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.

### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives.

  # wal-compaction-threshold = {{ data_wal_compaction_threshold }}

  # Force a flush and compaction if any series in a partition gets above this size in bytes
  # wal-max-series-size = {{ data_wal_max_series_size }}

  # Force a flush of all series and full compaction if there have been no writes in this
  # amount of time. This is useful for ensuring that shards that are cold for writes don't
  # keep a bunch of data cached in memory and in the WAL.
  # wal-flush-cold-interval = "{{ data_wal_flush_cold_interval }}"

  # Force a partition to flush its largest series if it reaches this approximate size in
  # bytes. Remember there are 5 partitions so you'll need at least 5x this amount of memory.
  # The more memory you have, the bigger this can be.

###
### [cluster]
###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is
### shared across shards.
###

[cluster]
  shard-writer-timeout = "{{ cluster_shard_writer_timeout }}"
  force-remote-mapping = {{ cluster_force_remote_mapping }}
  write-timeout = "{{ cluster_write_timeout }}"
  shard-mapper-timeout = "{{ cluster_shard_mapper_timeout }}"

###
### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

[retention]
  enabled = {{ retention_enabled }}
  check-interval = "{{ retention_check_interval }}"

[shard-precreation]
  enabled = {{ shard_pre_enabled }}
  check-interval = "{{ shard_pre_check_interval }}"
  advance-period = "{{ shard_pre_advance_period }}"

###
### [admin]
###
### Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface.
###

[admin]
  enabled = {{ admin_enabled }}
  bind-address = ":{{ admin_port }}"
  https-enabled = {{ admin_https_enabled }}
  https-certificate = "{{ admin_https_certificate }}"

[monitor]
  store-enabled = {{ monitor_store_enabled }}
  store-database = "{{ monitor_store_database }}"
  store-interval = "{{ monitor_store_interval }}"

###
### [http]
###
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.
###

[http]
  enabled = {{ http_enabled }}
  bind-address = ":{{ http_port }}"
  auth-enabled = {{ http_auth_enabled }}
  log-enabled = {{ http_log_enabled }}
  write-tracing = {{ http_write_tracing }}

###
### [[graphite]]
###
### Controls one or many listeners for Graphite data.
###

[[graphite]]
  enabled = false
  # bind-address = ":2003"
  # protocol = "tcp"
  # consistency-level = "one"
  # name-separator = "."
  # name-position = "last"

  # These next lines control how batching works. You should have this enabled
  # otherwise you could get dropped metrics or poor performance. Batching
  # will buffer points in memory if you have many coming in.

  # batch-size = 1000 # will flush if this many points get buffered
  # batch-pending = 5 # number of batches that may be pending in memory
  # batch-timeout = "1s" # will flush at least this often even if we haven't hit buffer limit

  ## "name-schema" configures tag names for parsing the metric name from graphite protocol;
  ## separated by `name-separator`.
  ## The "measurement" tag is special and the corresponding field will become
  ## the name of the metric.
  ## e.g. "type.host.measurement.device" will parse "server.localhost.cpu.cpu0" as
  ## {
  ##     measurement: "cpu",
  ##     tags: {
  ##         "type": "server",
  ##         "host": "localhost,
  ##         "device": "cpu0"
  ##     }
  ## }
  # name-schema = "type.host.measurement.device"

  ## If set to true, when the input metric name has more fields than `name-schema` specified,
  ## the extra fields will be ignored.
  ## Otherwise an error will be logged and the metric rejected.
  # ignore-unnamed = true
